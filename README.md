# Image Smoothing and Edge Detection using OpenCV

This repository contains Python code that utilizes the OpenCV library to perform image smoothing and edge detection on an input image. The code applies Gaussian smoothing to reduce noise and enhance image quality, and then performs edge detection using the Canny algorithm to identify and highlight edges in the image.

## Usage

1. Place your input image in the same directory as the code file.

2. Open the code file (`image_processing.py`) and specify the path to your input image by replacing the example image path.

3. Run the code, and it will apply image smoothing and edge detection to the input image.

4. The resulting images, both the smoothed image and the edge-detected image, will be saved in the same directory as the input image. The filenames of the processed images will have "_smoothed" and "_edges" appended to the original filename, respectively.

5. Check the output directory to find the processed images.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- OpenCV
